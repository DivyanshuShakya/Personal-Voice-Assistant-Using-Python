# Personal-Voice-Assistant-Using-Python
Usually, user needs to manually manage multiple sets of applications to complete one task. For 
example, a user trying to make a travel plan needs to check for airport codes for nearby airports and 
then check travel sites for tickets between combinations of airports to reach the destination. There is
need of a system that can manage tasks effortlessly. we already have multiple virtual assistants. But 
we hardly use it. There are number of people who have issues in voice recognition. These systems 
can understand English phrases but they fail to recognize in our accent Our way of pronunciation is 
way distinct from theirs also they are easy to use on mobile devices  than desktop systems. There is need of a virtual
 assistant that can understand English in Indian accent and work on desktop system. when a virtual 
assistant is not able to answer questions accurately, it’s because it lacks the proper context or 
doesn’t understand the intent of the question. Its ability to answer questions relevantly only happens
 with rigorous optimization, involving both humans and machine learning. Continuously ensuring 
solid quality control strategies will also help manage the risk of the virtual assistant learning 
undesired bad behaviours. They require large amount of information to be fed in order for it to work
 efficiently. virtual assistant should be able to model complex task dependencies and use these 
models to recommend optimized plans for the user. It needs to be tested for finding optimum paths 
when a task has multiple sub-tasks
 .
 and each sub-task can have its own sub-tasks. In Such a case there can be multiple solutions to 
paths, and the it should be able to consider user preferences, other active tasks, priorities in order to 
recommend a particular plan
 .
 Virtual assistants must provide a wide variety of services
 :
 These include
 .
 Providing information such as weather, facts from e.g., Wikipedia etc
 .
 Set an alarm or make to-do lists and shopping lists
 .
 Remind you of birthdays and meetings
